		</div>

		<p>For the past few months, they had been negotiating for an Asian American Studies program at Northwestern. As one of the 25 percent of Asian-Americans in her freshmen class, Pendakur felt that such a program that would seek to present the history, cultural contributions, and issues of Asian-Americans was only necessary.</p>

		<p>Pendakur had grown up in Evanston, IL, where she said was mostly 'black and white' in the 1990s. In Northwestern, she found herself embracing her Indian-American identity first by joining LOTUS, a student advocacy group for South Asians, and then participating in Asian American Advisory Board's (AAAB) political activities on campus. THere, she found that her desire to learn more about her own identity was shared by her fellow classmates. A few of them had been teaching student-led seminars on Asian-American Studies for the past few years and with the class hitting full capacity, they felt that it was time to get a more permanent program going.</p>

		<p>Professor Ji-Yeon Yuh, current director of Asian American Studies Program at Northwestern University, explains further the status quo at the time in this audio clip, originally recorded for the <a class ="link" href ="https://sites.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/naa/">NU Asian Archives project.</a></p>
		
		<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/139889973&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe>

		<p>In early February, the AAAB, the student advisory board dealing with advocacy for the Asian-American population on campus,  wrote up their own 200-page proposal for an Asian American studies program, which included plans to hire five professors and a program director. In this proposal, they <span id="aaabclick"style="color:#9E0508;font-weight:bold">explained</span> the importance of Asian American studies. </p>

		<img id ="proposalscreenshot" style="width:80%, margin-left: 5%" src="aaabproposal.jpg">
		
		<p style ="clear:both">This proposal garnered several letters of 
			<span id="profclick" style="color:#9E0508;font-weight:bold">faculty support</span> and over 1200 
			<span id="studentclick" style="color:#9E0508;font-weight:bold;clear:both">student signatures</span>.</p>
		
		<img id ="studentpetition" style="width:80%, margin-left: 5%" src="studentpetition.jpg">
		<img id="professorpetition" style= "width:80%, margin-left: 5%" src="profpetition.jpg">

		<p style ="clear:both">However, the response was less than what Pendakur and the AAAB had hoped for. Although Henry Bienen, then the president of Northwestern University, admitted that the cost of the proposed program were not prohibitive, he <a class ="link" href ="http://www.asianamerican.northwestern.edu/overview/aaab/bienen-letter-1.html">rejected</a> every single point of the AAAB's proposal. He acknowledged that there was a need and demand for the program but refused to commit to any action to demonstrate an intent to implement one. </p>

		<div style="margin-left: -200px">
			<blockquote id="articlequote" style="font-size:28px">
			Let me assure you as I assured the students with whom I met: I am not against this program. I have an open mind about it. I am against arbitrary deadlines to do this or that.	
			<cite>Henry Bienen, in a letter dated February 14, 1995 to Robert Yap</cite>
			</blockquote> 
		</div>

		<p>Again attempting to compromise, the AAAB revised their plan, asking for only two tenure-track professors and a director for an Asian American studies program. The administration countered with proposals for visiting lecturers and temporary programs. The students felt like they were getting nowhere and that the administration was simply stalling for time and waiting for them to graduate so that their demands could be quietly swept under the carpet.</p>

		<p>So on April 12th, they decided to fight.</p> 

		<p>At a rally of 300 students held to protest the administration's latest refusal to consider proposals, they announced the beginning of a hunger strike. </p>

		            <p>"It was a snowy and windy day when the AAAB held a 150-student strong rally and a march that started at The Rock and ended at the offices of President Bienen. Several students and student group leaders spoke at the rock about creating an Asian American Studies Program. They chanted slogans like "No program, no peace" and "We will not be ignored" as they made their way to Rebecca Crown Center, even though Bienen was not in office that entire day. Following this at 11 a.m. seventeen students announced and began a hunger strike, camping out in tents at the center of the Northwestern campus, drinking only water, vitamins and juice for sustenance. Accompanying them in solidarity were sixty students wo showed their support by pledging to fast for one day.       
		            <p>A vigil was held at midnight Wednesday night to help strikers to pass through the first night, during which students lit candles and read Asian-American literature to one another.</p>
		            <p>A nurse was stationed 24 hours a day in the basement of University Hall throughout the strike in case of emergencies.

		<h2>Across the nation</h2>
			<p>The energy and passion from Northwestern's hunger strike reverberated across many college campuses across the nation. Messages of support poured in from across the country. Universities that sent messages of solidarity or organized action in support of the demands at Northwestern included DePaul University, University of Illinois in Chicago, Notre Dame, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Brown University, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, University of Maryland, Cornell, University of Wisconsin, and Stanford. </p>

			<p>Professor Jinah Kim, now a professor at the Asian American Studies Program, was herself involved in the hunger strikes as an undergraduate in Columbia University. Here, she shares her experiences.

			<p>But that was not all. Students at <a class ="link" href ="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~rkim2/es/report.html">more and more universities</a> began advocating for ethnic studies and refused to yield to the conservative statism of their administrations. For the first time, they began to take action to make their case and voices heard. Following Northwestern's steps, Princeton students organized a sit-in and protest for Asian American and Latino Studies during April 20th to 21st, before Northwestern's hunger strike had even ended. </p>

			<p>A year after Northwestern's hunger strike in April 1996, as the student population at <a class ="link" href ="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/nyregion/columbia-students-begin-hunger-strike-for-ethnic-studies.html"> Columbia University in New York</a> grew more diverse, four Columbia students pitched a tent in the middle of campus and began a hunger strike, demanding the establishment of an ethnic studies department.</p>

		<h2>Beyond the strike</h2>

			<p> The hunger strikers of 1995 scored a minor victory with the four promised Asian American classes. However, progress from there happened at a slow pace. In <span id ="gracelouclick" style="color:#9E0508;font-weight:bold">May 1996</span>, Northwestern faculty voted to add an Asian American studies program to the curriculum but only chose to make it a small cluster of interdisciplinary courses rather than an academic minor and major. After the 1995 strike, it would take four years and more intense lobbying in order for the Asian American Studies Program to be finally established at Northwestern in 1999 as a minor in WCAS with two core faculty members. </p>

			<p style="clear: both">In June 2001, the first AAS minor graduates were <span id ="firstgradclick" style="color:#9E0508;font-weight:bold">Tammy Leung and Vishal Vaid.</span> None of the original hunger strikers ever got to take courses under this academic minor but as seen in this <em>Daily Northwestern</em> article, their actions had influenced later generations personally and profoundly.</p>

				We are not revolutionaries. We are not a bunch of rabble-rousing loose cannons. We are students. Students who ask for nothing more than a right to learn.
				<cite>AAAB in a statement quoted by the Chicago Tribune on April 24, 1996</cite>
				</blockquote>

			<p>Since then, the <a class ="link" href ="http://www.asianamerican.northwestern.edu/overview/index.html">program</a> has grown to consist of four core faculty as well as postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and lecturers. Together, they now offer more than 20 courses on various topics such as Asian American History; Asian/Black Relations; Asian American Literature; Asian American Rebels in Popular Culture; Race and the Prison Industrial Complex; Asian American Civil Rights; Race and Globalization; Asian American Religions; Bollywood and Beyond; Asians in Cinema; Topics in Vietnamese America; Race and Linguistics; Asian American Masculinities and Femininities and more.</p>

			<p>In this video, Prof. Kim speaks about the impact Asian American Studies has had on her students as well as on her professional career. </p>

			<p style ="clear:both">The hunger strike was not just asking for the establishment of a curriculum. The hunger strikers were also asking for the university's recognition of their culture and their ethnic group on campus. By building strong relationships with student leaders outside the Asian American community, students were able to build and lead this multicultural coalition to protest for diversity on behalf of the AAAB and the Asian American community. </p>

			<p>Noting that the Asian-American students had received support from white, black, and hispanic classmates and student organizations, Jennifer Taniguchi, one of the original hunger strikers, said, "The struggle is to make the administration responsive to the concerns of all students." Therefore, the strike serves as an example of great cross-cultural collaboration on a scale not oft seen on this campus, although student leaders of cultural groups recognize the merits of working together. </p>

			<p>In 2012, a group of Northwestern students started the Asian NU Project in order to bring together Northwestern's Asian community and to empower students to be proud of their identities. Many students in this project revisited the Asian American hunger strikes in 1995, seeing themselves as part of a long lineage of such student activism almost a decade ago.</p>
